Scarab of Ra in 4D

Level N is an MxMxM (M = 2n + 1) 3D maze, in which the goal is to find the way down to level N+1. (Problem: a mere 3D maze isn't really a 4D problem. Maybe there's some verticality in each level?)
	Need more efficient collision detection.

Walls are only visible in volume view if you've seen them in vertical slice view? Want to distinguish volume view as map view.

There are obstacles.
	traps
	slopes
	jumping puzzles?
	monsters
	doors
	puzzles?
	3D SOKOBAN?

Maybe there are monsters? You hear a growl.... Which direction is the monster coming from? Monsters will be hard to make.

Could make monsterous obstacles:
	Need Big Meat to get past the Wolf obstacle.
	Need Mirror to get past the Nymph obstacle.
	?

There are poison arrow traps where you may have to check in all six directions to find the port from which the arrow issues.

Need way to mark the ground. Must have multiple marks per hypertile.

Need ghosts for maze geometry close to slice.
